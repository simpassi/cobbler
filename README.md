# What is this?

This is a very simple SwiftUI player for what used to be Nectarine Demoscene Radio (now scenestream.net).

It directly plugs into one of the https/aac streams and pulls currently playing metadata using the scenestream XML API.

And since it's using the standard system component for media playback, your keyboard play/pause button will also work.

# Why "Cobbler"?

It's Apple devices with Nectarine (the demoscene radio).

So it's an apple-nectarine cobbler.

I know, it's a lousy name. But it's open source, feel free to rename your fork.

# Future features

Idk, maybe a playback queue list?

Enjoy.
